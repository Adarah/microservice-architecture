# 7. Add a separate pages service

Date: 2020-11-08

## Status

Accepted

## Context

The user should be able to access our terms of service and API documentation even if the main
system is down. 

## Decision

Keep the documentation and extra information pages in a separate service

## Consequences

The main system is decoupled from the auxiliary pages
