* Requirements
Definition: A redirect is a shortened URL that redirects a user to another website.
** Functional
- Create shortened URLs
- Control part of the path of the generated URLs
- Visitors who click the link will have their information tracked, including:
  - geolocation
  - number of visitors
  - operating system
- Create and retrieve a redirect's information from API endpoints
- Provide visualizations and aggregate information about the visitors who clicked the redirect
- Unregistered users can create redirects, but they won't have access to any analytics
** Non-functional
- A redirect is immutable
- Users only have access to analytics on redirects they own
- System must be scalable
- System must be able to maintain
